<h2>making your own static site with rust</h2>
<p>I love static site generators!</p>
<p>some of my friends might remember that i used to use <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">quartz</a> a lot, and it is a really good static site generator! its really pretty on default and easy to configure. if anyones getting into making their own site and looking for a generator i would really reccommend it!</p>
<p>But i guess one day i decided to work on making my own, since quartz has some of it's own quirks (i guess) that wouldn't allow me to configure things exactly the way i wanted.</p>
<p>Unfortuantely i dont know much web devlopment tools/frameworks. I mean i guess i can vibe code something up but i wanted to work on something that i can call my own, Not like im against using AI agents for coding projects but i wanted this personal website to feel like me (also why these blogs are not very formal and just thought dumps).</p>
<p>So everythings raw html and css!</p>
<p>For the actual website generating part, i used Rust. Rust is a cool language and all but i struggle using it and i would love to get better at writing rust code. I used the <a href="https://github.com/pulldown-cmark/pulldown-cmark">pulldown-cmark</a> crate for the markdown parsing.</p>
<p>In my final version (that is <em>very</em> slowly being worked on) of this static site generator, there are features such as table of contents/light dark mode/etc that would hopefully bring a better user experience. A tool that i have been using to work on this is <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde">serde</a> crate, which is a <em>framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures</em>, for quick JSON conversion, to save data from your code (i use it to keep track of the current files and other misc objects).</p>
<p>until i learn more javascript lol</p>
