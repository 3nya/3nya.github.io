My mom can't seem to ever agree with me. 


“你想过转校的事么？妈妈想你。“
*"Have you thought about transferring schools yet? Mom misses you."*  

This question felt so stupid to me. Why didn't you tell this before I committed? Why didn't you tell me this before I applied? Why didn't you tell me about this boundary beforehands?  


That kind of unconditional love and support, is something I will always be grateful for. And for that, I will keep bearing these disagreements for a lifetime.
