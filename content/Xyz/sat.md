My final score was a 1520, and this is a blog about my pathetic 3-year journey studying for SAT because to me, it was way more than just a test. Which it shouldn't be. A single quantitative number should never determine who you are, and I really got carried away with this. Hope this is a relatable read for some.

### Feeling dumb
I took the PSAT for the first time in 2021, when I was in 10th grade. It was my first time ever being exposed to a high school standarized test. I got a 1150/1520 and immediately felt on a worser level compared to my peers who got at least 1300. This would be my biggest secret during 10th grade, and I would continue to lie about it until the summer.  

This also created an immediate attraction to people who scored higher, it was standarized evidence of our academic standings, no matter what school or area we were from. Yes, you are better than me. Yes, I'm below you.  

### Academic validation
My parents enrolled me in an SAT Prep Center in the summer of 2022. They made us take a practice exam prior when registering, so they knew what leveled class they would put us in.   

I got a 1320 on the practice exam, which allowed me to be in their 'Advanced SAT Prep Class'.   

Immediate academic validation. Not only from the prep center but also from my parents, who were pretty disappointed from my previous score. It felt really nice, and unconsiously, I would put in my all to feel this feeling again.  

### Less and less
It only gets harder and harder to improve. When I got myself to the 1400-1450 range, it was all pinpointing down minor mistakes, and working to perfect those. These mistakes feel embedded into your brain. Habits are hard to get rid of.   

I finished off that summer by taking the August 2022 SAT exam, scoring a 1470. It was a 150 point improvement from when I started, but it wasn't good enough... for what? Making my family proud of me? Wanting more validation from my peers? Why did I want this so much? I didn't even had a dream college or any huge academic interest to pursue at the time.  

### Never feeling good enough
