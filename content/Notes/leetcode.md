Decided to start working on LeetCode upon entering college and finding a group of people who were willing to work on a problem set with me. Prior to this, I've done ~100 problems on CodeForces, ~30 problems on LeetCode, and ~60 USACO Bronze/Silver questions. However, I started working on this in 10th grade (when I started learning how to code), and I wasn't really focused on learning the algorithms behind a question.

Tl;dr: The way I've been learning is flawed and I'm trying to change that! This will include my notes on (almost) all the questions.
