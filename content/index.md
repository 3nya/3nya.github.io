I'm Enya. I'm mostly using this to dump my thoughts and stories, but I will try to add some of my school notes and projects from time to time so this seems more full and less random I guess...

It's nice to meet you!

- I'm an incoming freshmen at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in CS+Linguistics.
- I love to paint, eat yummy food, play games, talk with friends, normal people stuff lol
