### Introduction
This is the book that I made with Herricks Coding Club in 2023-2024. It is a 100-page book full of content and practice questions for beginners (targetted towards students in middle school) to learn the Python programming language! Over 15 members collaborated and wrote different sections of the book, and every page is written with passion ♡.  

### Purpose 
The purpose was not only to create something to improve coding education in our district's middle school, but also to create a more collaborative experience for the students in the high school. For any coding clubs out there looking to improve club participation, you should totally do something similar!  

### Going forward
The books content has been finalized for now, but I want to work on it more before considering it finished. Right now I'm currently working on uploading it on [GitHub](https://github.com/3nya/beginnersIntroToPython) in a readable way so anybody can easily fork the repository and complete the problems directly on the file. I would also like to create a functional website with it's content with a usable IDE within the page! But that is way more into the future when I can find people willing to work on it with me :)
